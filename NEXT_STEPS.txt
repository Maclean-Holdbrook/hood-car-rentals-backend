==================================
WHAT TO DO NOW IN SUPABASE
==================================

YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE! Just need to scroll up.

Option 1: SCROLL UP on the Database Settings page
--------------------------------------------------
You're currently at the BOTTOM of the page (showing SSL Configuration).
Scroll UP to the TOP of the page.
You should see a section called "Connection string" or "Connection info"

Look for something that shows:
- Host
- Database name
- Port
- User

Take a screenshot of that!


Option 2: Click the "Connect" button
------------------------------------
At the top of your Supabase page, there's a "Connect" button.
Click it and it will show you the connection details.


Option 3: Try the API Settings
------------------------------
1. In the left sidebar, click on the GEAR icon (Settings)
2. Click on "API" instead of "Database"
3. Scroll down to find "Database URL" or connection details

==================================

Once you find it, you're looking for a HOST that looks like:
  aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com
  OR
  db.kanswmvhvwdtwyzgsnwf.supabase.co

From your URL, I can see part of it:
  kanswmvhvwdtwyzgsnwf

So your host is probably:
  db.kanswmvhvwdtwyzgsnwf.supabase.co
